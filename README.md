# The Sample Store

This store is being used as a starting point for `The Solidus Guide to ReactJS` workshop held at [SolidusConf 2020](conf.solidus.io).

To get started, open a terminal and perform the following actions:
* Navigate to the folder you'd like this project to be in
* `git clone https://github.com/seand7565/solidus-store.git`
* `cd solidus-store`
* `bundle install`
* `yarn install`
* `bin/rails db:migrate`
* `bin/rails db:seed`
* `bin/rails spree_sample:load`

Now you have a starting point for the workshop! If you have any trouble during these steps, feel free to ask in the chat, but keep in mind that we've got a lot of ground to cover so we may not be able to address every issue! The workshop _will_ be recorded, so don't panic - you can come back later and follow along once you've got this working.
